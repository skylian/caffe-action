# Action Recognition with Deep Learning

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/yjxiong/caffe.svg?branch=action_recog)](https://travis-ci.org/yjxiong/caffe)

This branch hosts the code for the technical report ["Towards Good Practices for Very Deep Two-stream ConvNets"](http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.02159), and more.

### Updates
- Dec 23, 2015
  * Refactored cudnn wrapper to control overall memory consumption. Will automatically find the best algorithm combination under memory constraint.
- Dec 17, 2015
  * cuDNN v4 support: faster convolution and batch normalization (around 20% performance gain).
- Nov 22, 2015
  * Now python layer can expose a `prefetch()` method, which will be run in parallel with network processing.

[Full Change Log](CHANGELOG.md)

### Features
- `VideoDataLayer` for inputing video data.
- Training on optical flow data. 
- Data augmentation with fixed corner cropping and multi-scale cropping.
- Parallel training with multiple GPUs.
- cuDNNv4 integration.

### Usage

*See more in* [Wiki](https://github.com/yjxiong/caffe/wiki).

Generally it's the same as the original caffe. Please see the original README. 
Please see following instruction for accessing features above. More detailed documentation is on the way.

- Video/optic flow data
  - First use the [optical flow extraction tool](https://github.com/wanglimin/dense_flow) to convert videos to RGB images and opitcal flow images.
  - A new data layer called `VideoDataLayer` has been added to support multi-frame input. See the UCF101 sample for how to use it.
  - **Note:** The `VideoDataLayer` can only input the optical-flow images generated by the tool listed above.
- Fixed corner cropping augmentation
  - Set `fix_crop` to `true` in `tranform_param` of network's protocol buffer definition.
- "Multi-scale" cropping augmentation
  - Set `multi_scale` to `true` in `transform_param`
  - In `transform_param`, specify `scale_ratios` as a list of floats smaller than one, default is `[1, .875, .75, .65]`
  - In `transform_param`, specify `max_distort` to an integer, which will limit the aspect ratio distortion, default to `1`
- cuDNN v4
 - The cuDNN v4 wrapper has optimized engines for convolution and batch normalization.
 - The solver protobuf config has a parameter `richness` which specifies the total GPU memory in MBs available to the cudnn convolution engine as workspaces. Default `richness` is 300 (300MB). Using this parameter you can control the GPU memory consumption of training, the system will find the best setup under the memory limit for you.
- Training with multiple GPUs
  - Requires OpenMPI > 1.7.4 ([Why?](https://www.open-mpi.org/faq/?category=runcuda)). **Remember to compile your OpenMPI with option `--with-cuda`**
  - Specify list of GPU IDs to be used for training, in the solver protocol buffer definition, like `device_id: [0,1,2,3]`
  - Compile using cmake and use `mpirun` to launch caffe executable, like 
```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DUSE_MPI=ON
make && make install
mpirun -np 4 ./install/bin/caffe train --solver=<Your Solver File> [--weights=<Pretrained caffemodel>]
```
**Note**: actual batch_size will be `num_device` times `batch_size` specified in network's prototxt.

  - [Caffe Model Files](https://github.com/yjxiong/caffe/tree/action_recog/models/action_recognition)
  - [Training scripts and data files examples](https://github.com/yjxiong/caffe/tree/action_recog/examples/action_recognition)
  - [Optical Flow Data](http://mmlab.siat.ac.cn/very_deep_two_stream_model/ucf101_flow_img_tvl1_gpu.zip)
- Scene recognition on Places205
  - [Model Files](https://github.com/wanglimin/Places205-VGGNet)
  - [Technical Report](http://wanglimin.github.io/papers/WangGHQ15.pdf)

### Extension
Currently all existing data layers sub-classed from `BasePrefetchingDataLayer` support parallel training. If you have newly added layer which is also sub-classed from `BasePrefetchingDataLayer`, simply implement the virtual method 
```C++
inline virtual void advance_cursor();
```
Its function should be forwarding the "data cursor" in your data layer for one step. Then your new layer will be able to provide support for parallel training.
